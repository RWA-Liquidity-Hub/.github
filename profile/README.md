# RLH (RWA Liquidity Hub)

## Introduction

Our vision is to establish a cohesive platform where liquidity for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) across multiple blockchains can be seamlessly aggregated and accessed.

The RWA Liquidity Hub (RLH) brings tokenized assets into a single, user-friendly collateral market powered by AI. By abstracting away the complexities of managing liquidity across multiple blockchains, RLH would create a centralized marketplace with enhanced liquidity and efficiency for RWAs.

## AI-Driven Interaction for Simplified Transactions

The interaction for borrowing and lending is conversational, effectively abstracting away most interactions with the underlying blockchain technology. Users now only need to sign pre-built transactions rather than navigating complex parameters like health factors, optimal borrowing markets, or pools offering the best risk-adjusted returns.

## Interoperability: Breaking Down Barriers for Seamless DeFi Experiences

Interoperability, the ability to seamlessly view, access, and exchange information across various blockchains, is the cornerstone of DeFi initiatives. One common pitfall we observe in DeFi/web3 dapps is the reuse of identical designs across multiple chains. This fragmentation of liquidity further impedes adoption.

## Why Algorand: The Ideal Blockchain for RWA Tokenization

We have chosen Algorand as the underlying blockchain for several compelling reasons. Algorand employs a pure proof of stake (PPoS) consensus protocol, ensuring a non-forking chain. This non-forking characteristic is crucial for equities, as disputes regarding which fork to follow can lead to conflicts among investors and potential lawsuits. PPoS stands out over proof of stake (PoS) in this regard, as it eliminates slashing and forking altogether.
